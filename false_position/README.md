# False Posistion Root Finding
The algorithm can find roots for a function. 
#### Inputs
(funciton, x lower bound, x upperbound, error aproximate, max iterations).
The apporximate error and max iterations are optional inputs. If approximate error isnt inputed it runs at 0.01%
and if max iterations isn't inputed it runs to 200 interations. 
#### Outputs
[root, function of the root, approxiamte error, iteration]
#### Restrictions
The only limitations on the program is that the lower and upper x bounds have to bracket the root.
