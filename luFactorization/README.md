#### Inputs
The only input neccesary is the Matrix you want to factorize
#### Outputs
The function outputs the Lower Matrix, the upper matrix and the pivot matrix. The pivot matrix is how your input matrix was pivoted 
so Input matrix*Pivot matrix is the actuall matrix that was factorized.
#### Restrictions
